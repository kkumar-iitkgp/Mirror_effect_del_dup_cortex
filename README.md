## Repository Contents
Code for the analysis and figures for the Mirror effect of genomic deletions and duplications across the cortex. The repository is organized into three main components: 
* CC-GSBA: cerebral-cortex gene-set burden analysis (CC-GSBA) pipeline, with simulated toy phenotype data and run;
* Figs: R Markdown (.Rmd) files containing the steps and code to generate the main figures and their associated statistics;
* * SupFigs: R Markdown (.Rmd) files containing the steps and code for generating the supplementary figures. 

In addition, the gene-sets used in the paper (due to size), along with a version of this code, are hosted on **Zenodo** at: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17593039](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17593039)

## CC-GSBA Workflow
Our methodology for associating CNVs with cognitive ability by leveraging gene expression data across cortical regions. The analysis integrates genotypic and phenotypic data from large population cohorts with gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA).

- Gene Assignment: Each gene is mapped to cortical regions where it shows preferential expression (z-score > 0.5). This process is repeated for all genes, resulting in 180 distinct regional gene sets.
- CNV Aggregation: For each individual, we calculate two burden metrics for each cortical region:
- Gene-Set Burden: The count of CNVs overlapping genes within a specific regional gene set.
- Genome Burden: The count of CNVs outside that specific regional gene set, serving as a genome-wide control.
Regression Analysis: A regression model is applied to test for a region-specific association between CNV burden and cognitive ability, while controlling for the genome-wide burden and other covariates.  Cognitive ability (Y) is modeled as a function of the Gene-Set Burden and the Genome Burden. The model also adjusts for standard covariates such as age, sex, and ancestry.

#### The core script:
The CC-GSBA script is the core pipeline for testing the association between CNVs (Copy Number Variations) aggregated in cortex-specific gene sets and cognitive ability.

#### Data Used in This Repository : 

This repository's pipeline runs on synthetic and non-sensitive toy data to allow for development, testing, and demonstration without the need for access to real human genetic data. The datasets included are:

- Toy Dataset of CNV by Individual: A simulated matrix representing CNV status across individuals.

- Toy Dataset of Gene by CNV: A mapping of CNVs to the genes they affect.

- Simulated Cognitive Ability Measure: A synthetic phenotype/score for the individuals.

- Quality Control Individuals: A subset of individuals who pass a simulated quality control process.

- Real Gene Sets: The actual gene sets (derived from CC_GSBA, assigning section) that are used to aggregate CNV burden.
  
#### File Types
The main CC-GSBA pipeline is implemented in Python Notebooks (*.ipynb).
The toy datasets and real gene sets are all in (*.tsv) formats. See **Zenodo** at: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17593039](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17593039)
for a full set of gene sets. 

#### 💻 Usage

1. Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3.11 (for the CC-GSBA notebook) and R version 4.2.2 (for the figures) installed, along with the necessary packages (see requirements.txt).
   
2. Clone the repository:

```bash


git clone https://github.com/SayehKazem/CC_GSBA.git


cd CC_GSBA


```
